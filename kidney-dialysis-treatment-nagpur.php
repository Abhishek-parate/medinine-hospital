            <p>
                When kidneys lose their ability to filter waste and excess fluids from the blood, dialysis becomes a life-sustaining treatment [web:1]. At Medinine Hospital, our **24/7 Kidney Dialysis Treatment** services in Nagpur are designed to provide patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and acute kidney failure the highest standard of care [web:5]. Dialysis is performed when kidney function is reduced to 10-15%, a critical stage where the body can no longer eliminate toxins effectively [web:4]. Our state-of-the-art dialysis center is equipped with advanced German technology and staffed by a dedicated team of nephrologists, certified hemodialysis technicians, registered nurses, and dieticians who work together to deliver personalized, compassionate care.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our comprehensive approach goes beyond the dialysis procedure itself. We understand that living with kidney disease requires ongoing support, education, and lifestyle management [web:1][web:2]. From the initial diagnosis to long-term treatment planning, our multidisciplinary team provides holistic care that addresses every aspect of kidney health. We offer both hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis options, allowing patients to choose the treatment method that best fits their lifestyle and medical needs. Our commitment is to improve quality of life, manage complications, and provide hope through expert medical care and continuous monitoring. As one of the **best super-speciality hospitals in Nagpur** for nephrology services, we ensure that every patient receives individualized attention and the most advanced treatment protocols available.
            </p>
            
            <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-primary mt-8 mb-4">Understanding Dialysis: Types and Methods</h3>
            <p>
                Dialysis is a medical treatment that replicates the essential functions of healthy kidneys by filtering waste products, removing excess fluids, and balancing electrolytes in the blood [web:1]. There are two primary types of dialysis, each using different methods to cleanse the blood:
            </p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside mt-4 space-y-2">
                <li><strong>Hemodialysis:</strong> The most common form of dialysis where blood is filtered through an external dialysis machine [web:1]. During hemodialysis, blood is removed from the body through a vascular access point, passed through a dialyzer (artificial kidney) that filters out waste and excess fluid, and then returned to the body. This treatment typically requires three sessions per week, each lasting 3-4 hours.</li>
                <li><strong>Peritoneal Dialysis:</strong> Uses the lining of the abdomen (peritoneum) as a natural filter [web:6]. A special solution called dialysate is introduced into the abdominal cavity through a surgically placed catheter. The peritoneal membrane acts as a filter, absorbing waste products and toxins from the blood, which are then drained away with the dialysate.</li>
                <li><strong>Continuous Ambulatory Peritoneal Dialysis (CAPD):</strong> A manual form of peritoneal dialysis that does not require a machine and can be performed 3-5 times daily during waking hours [web:6][web:9].</li>
                <li><strong>Continuous Cyclic Peritoneal Dialysis (CCPD) / Automated Peritoneal Dialysis (APD):</strong> Uses a special dialysis machine that automatically performs exchanges while the patient sleeps [web:6][web:9].</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="mt-4">
                Our nephrologists work closely with each patient to determine the most appropriate dialysis method based on their medical condition, lifestyle preferences, and overall health goals. We provide comprehensive training and support for patients choosing home-based peritoneal dialysis options, ensuring they feel confident and capable in managing their treatment [web:1].
            </p>
