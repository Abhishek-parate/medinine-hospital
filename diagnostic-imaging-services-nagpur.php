            <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-primary mt-8 mb-4">Our Advanced Imaging Modalities</h3>
            <p>
                Our diagnostic imaging department is equipped with multiple imaging modalities to address diverse medical needs [web:5][web:7]. Each technology serves a specific purpose in visualizing different body structures and conditions:
            </p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside mt-4 space-y-2">
                <li><strong>Computed Tomography (CT Scan):</strong> Provides detailed cross-sectional images of bones, organs, and blood vessels, essential for trauma assessment, cancer detection, and surgical planning [web:1][web:6].</li>
                <li><strong>Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI):</strong> Offers superior soft tissue visualization without radiation, ideal for brain, spinal cord, joint, and musculoskeletal imaging [web:1][web:5].</li>
                <li><strong>Digital X-Ray:</strong> The most widely used imaging technique for detecting fractures, lung infections, and dental conditions with minimal radiation exposure [web:6][web:8].</li>
                <li><strong>Ultrasound (Sonography):</strong> Uses high-frequency sound waves to create real-time images of internal organs, widely used in obstetrics, cardiology, and abdominal assessments [web:6].</li>
                <li><strong>Mammography:</strong> Specialized breast imaging for early detection of breast cancer and other abnormalities [web:1][web:5].</li>
                <li><strong>Fluoroscopy:</strong> Real-time moving images of internal structures, useful for gastrointestinal studies and guided procedures [web:1].</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="mt-4">
                Our advanced equipment delivers high-resolution images with reduced scan times, enhancing patient comfort while maintaining diagnostic accuracy [web:7]. Each modality is operated by certified technicians and interpreted by board-certified radiologists who specialize in their respective imaging fields.
            </p>
            
            <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-primary mt-8 mb-4">CT Scan & MRI Excellence</h3>
            <p>
                Our CT and MRI services represent the pinnacle of diagnostic imaging technology in Nagpur [web:6]. The CT scanner combines multiple X-ray images to create detailed cross-sectional views of the body, providing comprehensive visualization of bones, soft tissues, and blood vessels [web:9]. This technology is particularly valuable for cardiology assessments, detecting internal injuries, and planning complex surgeries [web:6].
            </p>
            <p>
                Our MRI facility offers multiple Tesla strength options for optimal image quality across different clinical applications [web:5]. MRI excels at visualizing soft tissues, making it the preferred choice for neurological conditions, spinal disorders, joint injuries, and cancer staging [web:1]. The non-invasive nature of MRI, combined with its lack of ionizing radiation, makes it safe for repeated examinations when monitoring treatment progress or chronic conditions. Our radiology team works closely with referring physicians to ensure the appropriate imaging protocol is selected for each patient's specific clinical question.
            </p>


            <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-primary mt-8 mb-4">Digital X-Ray & Ultrasound Services</h3>
            <p>
                As a leading **X-ray hospital in Nagpur**, we utilize advanced digital radiography systems that provide immediate image availability and superior image quality compared to traditional film-based X-rays [web:7]. Digital X-rays are essential for diagnosing fractures, chest infections, dental problems, and bone abnormalities [web:8]. The technique uses minimal radiation while delivering clear images that can be easily shared with specialists for consultation.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our ultrasound department offers comprehensive sonography services for various medical specialties [web:6]. Ultrasound imaging is completely safe, using sound waves rather than radiation, making it the preferred imaging method during pregnancy and for pediatric patients [web:6]. We provide obstetric ultrasounds for prenatal care, abdominal ultrasounds for organ assessment, vascular ultrasounds for blood flow evaluation, and musculoskeletal ultrasounds for soft tissue injuries. The real-time imaging capability of ultrasound also makes it valuable for guiding minimally invasive procedures such as biopsies and fluid drainage.
            </p>
